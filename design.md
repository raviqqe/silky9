# design

## architecture

```
computer = processor { processor }
processor = token_queue program_memory instruction_executer
```


## behavior

### launch of processors

### dispatch of a program

### execution of a program

### termination of processors

* int's 1/x seems not to be defined
* definition of virtual bool type
  * false := 0b0..0
  * true /= false
  * virtual bool type has same expression as int
* io
  * take an id of syscall and its arguments as a stream
  * read command line arguments by io
  * sync only by io and sync only for io

* bigger and smaller instuctions for int and real?
* io's operandBuff = fd?
* shutdown by io?
